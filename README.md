# Annual Income Prediction using Machine Learning

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether an individual's annual income exceeds **$50K** based on demographic and employment-related attributes. The project is built using **Scikit-Learn**, with a complete preprocessing pipeline and model serialization using **Joblib**.

The dataset used is the **Adult Census Income Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete supervised machine learning workflow, including:

- Data collection from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values
- Feature encoding
- Building a preprocessing pipeline
- Model training and evaluation
- Model serialization using Joblib

The trained model is stored as a reusable pipeline, making it ready for deployment in a web application or REST API.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these steps:

1. Load the Adult Census Income dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Handle missing values.
4. Encode categorical variables.
5. Build a preprocessing pipeline.
6. Train a Machine Learning classification model.
7. Evaluate model performance.
8. Save the trained preprocessing pipeline and model using Joblib.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The saved pipeline performs:

- Missing value handling
- Categorical feature encoding
- Numerical feature transformation
- Complete preprocessing
- Classification model inference

Saving the entire preprocessing pipeline ensures consistent predictions on unseen data.
